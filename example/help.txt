Hello, I am example of RemoteFox's IRC class for python.
(https://github.com/Bystroushaak/FrozenIdea2)

Usage:
    add <new todo>
    rm/remove <num/*> -- index of row you want to delete or * for all rows
    ls/list [match] -- list all or `match`ing TODOs
    see/see_diff -- show your current time diff settings
    set/set_diff -- adds your own time diff (how long it takes to send you another warning) (in seconds)
